## I loves you Porgy - Gershwin (arr. Nina Simone)

Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7RoA-JI6Us).

I found this recording in college, and talked to a long time friend and roommate about it. We both agreed there was one word that summed up this piece. 
*Haunted*.
I still don’t think I can summarize it better than that, but as for listening notes:
I mainly like the way Nina Simone plays with time in this piece. I like the amorphous and non-metered sound she uses when the lyrics are talking about love, and the way the music drags when she’s talking about having to leave.
I also like the arrangement being as small as it is. If this was larger, I think it would loose much of the intimacy that makes it emotionally heavier.
