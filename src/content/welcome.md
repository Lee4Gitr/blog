Welcome guys, this is my blog.

Since global concerns about COVID-19 have me living indoors most hours of the day, I thought now would be a great time to start a blog. On top of being a longer form of communication, the concerns I have with sharing personal information through social media begin to evaporate (although still not completely) when I’m hosting my own site. I’m going to share all the things I enjoy here, which is a vast array of subjects. 

I hope you enjoy.
